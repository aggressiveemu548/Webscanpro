# WebScanPro

Educational project started as part of Infosys Springboard virtual internship.

Files:
- SCOPE.md — project scope and acceptance criteria
- ETHICS.md — legal & ethical testing rules (read before scanning)
- ROADMAP.md — short development roadmap

Next steps:
1. Read ETHICS.md and SCOPE.md.
2. Create the planning branch and add these files to the repo.
