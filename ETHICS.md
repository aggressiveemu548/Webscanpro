# WebScanPro â€” Legal & Ethical Guidelines

**Core rule:** Only scan targets you own or have explicit written authorization to test.

## Before any active testing:
1. Obtain written permission (email or signed document).
2. Agree on scope: allowed IPs/URLs and test window.
3. Have contact and rollback plan for target owner.

## Tool-enforced rules:
- Default mode: passive-only checks.
- Active scanning (e.g., OWASP ZAP) requires explicit user consent in the UI and confirmation of written permission.

## Forbidden:
- Scanning without authorization.
- Sharing sensitive data captured from a target.
- Using WebScanPro for offensive or criminal purposes.

## Recommended practice:
- Use local test apps such as OWASP Juice Shop, DVWA, or WebGoat when learning.
